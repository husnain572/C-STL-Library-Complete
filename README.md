# C++ STL Library

This repository contains a collection of examples and practical applications of the **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**. It is intended to provide an in-depth understanding of the common STL containers, iterators, and algorithms. The repository includes practical code snippets and explanations for key STL features.

## ðŸ“š Contents

- **Vectors**: Dynamic arrays with automatic resizing.
- **Pairs**: A container to store two values of potentially different types.
- **Lists**: Doubly-linked lists for efficient insertions and deletions.
- **Maps**: Sorted associative containers that store key-value pairs.
- **Sets**: Containers that store unique elements, sorted by default.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) containers.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) containers.
- **Iterators**: For traversing through containers.
- **Algorithms**: Common STL algorithms for sorting, searching, etc.

## ðŸ”¨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Resizing**: Containers like `vector` automatically resize as elements are added or removed.
- **Efficient Data Access**: Use of iterators to access elements within containers.
- **Type Safety**: STL containers support type safety through templates.
- **Ease of Use**: Built-in functions for container manipulation (e.g., `push_back()`, `insert()`, `erase()`).

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- **Container Types**: Includes sequences like `vector`, `list`, `deque`, associative containers like `map` and `set`, and adapter containers like `queue` and `stack`.
- **Iterators**: Used to iterate over elements in a container (e.g., `begin()`, `end()`, `rbegin()`, `rend()`).
- **Algorithms**: Includes sorting, searching, and other functions that operate on containers.
